## Project_description

The application will allow users to register and log in to access their personal task lists. Its name FRELUJ comes from the combination of the names of the project developers.
Once inside, they will be able to create new tasks by specifying a title, an optional description, a deadline, and possibly a priority.
Users will be able to mark tasks as completed when they have finished them and delete them from the list.

To enhance the user experience, the application could be responsive, meaning compatible with mobile devices, allowing users to manage their tasks on the go.

It could also include collaboration features, such as sharing task lists with other users and assigning tasks to different team members in collaborative work environments.

## Project_Status

In progress or Active: The project is underway, and activities are being carried out to achieve the established objectives.

## Steps by Install Django

First, we enter the folder where our remote repository is located

After being located in our repository, we enter Python mode by typing the command "py" to verify that we have Python installed. Exit the Pyhton environment with the command "exit()".

Create a new folder with the command "mkdir" and assign it a name, in our case it will be 'project'. Enter the newly created folder with the command "cd" and create an environment with the following command "py -m venv venv".

We use the following command ".\venv\Scripts\activate.bat" to activate and enter the local Python environment. Once inside the local environment we use the following command "pip install django" to install Django in our local Phyton environment.
